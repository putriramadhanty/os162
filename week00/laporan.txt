Last week (week 0), we were asked to answer a thread with our names as our attendance in the class,\n 
and then we had to make a google account and github account (github account as our repository to submit every task).\n
Next, we had to fill a google form to register ourself to the class so that the lecturer noticed us.\n
Finally, wait for 24 hours to see that our named already registered.\n
