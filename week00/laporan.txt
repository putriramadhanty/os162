Last week (week 0), we were asked to answer a thread with our nameas out attendance in the class, and then we had to make a google account and github account (github account as our repository to submit every task).Next, we had to fill a google form to register ourself to the class so that the lecturer noticed us. Finally, wait for 24 hours to see that our named already registered.
